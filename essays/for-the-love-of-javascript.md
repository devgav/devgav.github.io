## Javascript vs Java

Before learning javascript I was only exposed to Java and C/C++ which are both statically typed languages. Instead of writing 
```java
String name;
name = “John”; //Allowed
name = 34; //Not allowed
```
we can write 
```javascript
Let name;
name = “John”; //Allowed
name = 34; //Allowed
```
 my thought of being able to reassign a variable to anything you want is that it is a double-edged sword. I can see how for a larger code base finding bugs could be difficult if you are able to reassign variables to whatever you want and creating errors in your code makes it just that much more easy. However, I think that the speed at which you can develop in javascript and the vast support for the programming language is the reason why you continue to see it everywhere, also I think that being able to reassign variables is not a bad thing and issues that I have had could be addressed by programmers more experience with the language. 

## Javascript glows up

I learnt Javascript for my job as a web developer back in June of 2021. However, I have never had the chance to create many projects using Javascript and I have never really gotten to complete many tasks in the front-end of our website. Although, that may change after going through the FreeCodeCamp javascript course. The course has taught me things that I was initially confused about mainly newer features released in ES6. I didn’t know that there were a vast amount of shortcuts for programming in javascript. I was extremely excited to learn more about the arrow function because we use that in our UH Groupings project and I was always confused on how the arrow functions worked. I think that ES6 will allow me to express my use of javascript and I hope to be able to use these more in the future.

## Athletic software engineering

If you have ever tried to learn something you will know how difficult it is to start learning without being able to apply what you have learned. With WODs (Workouts of the day) I am able to directly apply what I have learned to a question to test my knowledge on a specific topic. The time limit that we are given on WODs simulates the pressure and stress that many software engineering interviews are like. These WODs will promote my growth as a software engineer and takes very little time (about 15-20 minutes) which is important to help consistency.
